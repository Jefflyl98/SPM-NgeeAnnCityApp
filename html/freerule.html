    <h1>Free Play Game Rules</h1>
    <p>In Free Play mode, this city-building game has an unlimited number of coins and begins with a grid of 5x5. In each turn, the player can construct any of the buildings in the city, on any cell in the city. Each construction costs 1 coin. Once a building is constructed along the border of the city, additional 5 more rows of cells are added to the perimeter of the city. The city will expand to 15x15 on the first expansion, and 25x25 on the second expansion.</p>
    <p>A building is adjacent to another building if they are connected via the same road. The scoring of the buildings is the same as that in Arcade mode.</p>

        <h1>Help - Game Rules</h1>
        <p>As the mayor of Ngee Ann City, your goal is to build the happiest and most prosperous city possible, scoring the most points.</p>
        <p>There are 2 game modes: Arcade mode and Free Play mode.</p>

        <h2>Arcade Mode</h2>
        <p>In Arcade mode, the game begins with 16 coins. Each turn, you will construct one of two randomly selected buildings in the 20x20 city grid, costing 1 coin each. The first building can be placed anywhere, but subsequent buildings must be connected to existing ones. The building not chosen is discarded.</p>


        <h2>Free Play Mode</h2>
        <p>In Free Play mode, the game starts with unlimited coins and a 5x5 grid. Each turn, you can construct any building in the city on any cell, costing 1 coin each. When a building is placed along the city's border, the grid expands by 5 rows. The city will expand to 15x15 on the first expansion and 25x25 on the second.</p>
        <p>A building is adjacent to another if they are connected via the same road. Scoring is the same as in Arcade mode.</p>
